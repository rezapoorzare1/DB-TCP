This repository contains all the files for the letter "Deep Learning TCP for Improving mmWave 5G Performance due to NLoS Impairments". 
All the files, including python and C++ files (scenarios and codes for the protocol), training sets, and evaluation sets can be found.
Python codes can be run in colab.research.google, or any other Python platform. 
The C++ codes can be implemented in the ns3-mmWave module.
DB-TCP (Deep learning Based-TCP) is a new TCP based on deep learning that can outperform other common TCPs in terms of throughput, RTT, and congestion window fluctuation. The prime potential borrowed by deep learning is the ability to distinguish various conditions in the network.
